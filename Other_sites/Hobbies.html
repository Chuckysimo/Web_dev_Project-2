    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>In my “productive” free time, I try to extend my IT knowledge – learning web development and I also plan to learn programming in Phyton.  I focus on sports and music as a relaxation. My most common sport activities include cycling, workout, hiking and Via Ferrata. I play drums and guitar. I enjoy organizing holidays, trips and adventures. I am interested in history, and I love traveling.</p>
